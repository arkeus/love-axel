Love Axel
=========

What?
-----

A simple version of Axel for use with LÃ–VE.

Example Of Use?
---------------

See [Love Lumberjack](https://github.com/arkeus/love-lumberjack) for an example of how to use it. It's simple at the moment, but it's a work in progress.

Why?
----

An experiment to get experience creating a game with a dynamic language.

Can I use this?
---------------

Go for it. You'll need to dive through the source and take a look at [Love Lumberjack](https://github.com/arkeus/love-lumberjack) as documentation though. It's possible I may write up full documentation if the project goes far enough.
